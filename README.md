# Text Displayer

Render images as ascii text.

## Usage

```textdisp.exe path\to\image.png 80 40```
will generate an ascii image 80 characters wide and 40 characters tall of the image in path\to\image.png

## Future Work

I would like to convert this from an executable to a library module so I can reuse it in some of my other projects.
